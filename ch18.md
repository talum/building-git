# Chapter 18 When Merges Fail

What happens when changes overlap?!?

## 18.1 A little refactoring
Q: Hm, how do we like this?

`Merge::Inputs` takes two revisions, left and right, resolves them to IDs. Determines the BCA using `Merge::Bases`.
- to me, this seems like a strange, very generic name
- on the other hand, it introduces the idea of a left and right side of a merge 

`Merge::Resolve` reconciles changes and applies them to index and workspace 


## 18.2 Null and fast-forward merges

### 18.2.1 Merging an existing ancestor
> `null merge` occurs when the requested merge commit is already reachable from the current HEAD

Check if the requested merge commit is reachable from HEAD i.e. HEAD already incorporates its changes so do nothing. 

### 18.2.2 Fast-forward merge
> `fast-forward merge`...BCA is equal to HEAD

> Recall our formula for computing a merge tree3: TM = TB + dBL + dBR, where L and R are the left and right input commits and B is their best common ancestor. But if the BCA is the same as the HEAD commit, that means that B = L and dBL is zero.

No need to build the tree of the merge => it is the tree of the merged commit. Just need to move the master branch pointer to refer to the merged commit and check it out.

Fast-forward means just shuttling HEAD pointer along existing history.

`--no-ff` will construct new merge commit...is not default.

## 18.3 Conflicted index entries

### 18.3.1 Inspecting the conflicted repository
 unmerged paths! HEAD has not moved!
 
### 18.3.2 Stages in the index
- "Stage number"
- `git ls-files --stage`
- non-zero stage means the repository is in a conflict state
- oh boy, back to hdexdumps of the index 

### 18.3.3 Storing entries by stage
- Need to store entries by path and stage and sorted 
- key becomes [path, stage]
- do some bit-shifting to get the 13th and 14th bits from the right (aka the flags)
- update index methods `entry_for_path` and `tracked_file?` and `remove_entry`

### 18.3.4 Storing conflicts
- stage 0 means file is clean while any other stage present means the file is conflicted
- create entries in the index from the DB, but give them all stat info of 0 since they aren't real files in the workspace 
- do some math to get the flags

## 18.4 Conflict detection
- run into problems when the index doesn't match the pre-image or post-image for a path (HEAD branch has changed one of the files that the incoming branch has also changed)

### 18.4.1 Concurrency, causality and locks
> merging changes from partially ordered commits means we need to be able to interpret the commits as though they formed a flat linear sequence 

- when one commit follows another via its parent link, we're good
- when two commits are not explicitly ordered, then we can't assume. that would result in data loss

Locks would turn git into a centralized system and we don't want that. Instead, authors need to manually tell Git how to fix resulting data conflicts.

### 18.4.2 Add/edit/delete conflicts
- Changes to different files commute (can be reordered with same result)
- `Merge::Resolve` needs to analyze branches asked to merge and flag any conflicts that result from both sides modifying the same file 
- build a tree that can be applied to the index
- calculate two tree diffs, one between merge and left commit, and one between base and right commit


### 18.4.3 File/directory conflicts
