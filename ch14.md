# Chapter 14

`checkout` command: applies changes to the repository, restore to state they were in after creating the commit that ref points at

## 14.1 Telling trees apart

option 1: delete every tracked file and the index and rebuild both of thme from new tree. make sure it's consistent. but it's wasteful.

option 2: figure out which files differ between HEAD and <rev>

Merkle trees ftw. Check the object id of directory to see if same.
  
`Database::TreeDiff`: to detect differences in trees
 - only retain differences between files 
 - directories will be implicitly created as needed
 - detect deletions vs detect additions (compare two trees and recurse if necessary) 
  
## 14.2 Planning the changes
 - create a Migration 
 - I like it, reminds me of Terraform plan
 - "dry run" for scripts
 - creating/destroying things: desire to make it atomic 
  
 - order in a filesystem is important!
 
## 14.3 Updating the workspace
  - apply planned changes: deleted, update, create
  - deletes files that exist at that path before creating it again and inserting contents

## 14.4 Updating the index
  - apply migration changes to index as well as workspace
  - update .git/HEAD to point at the commit we're migrating to

## 14.5 Preventing conflicts
  - `Inspector` class
  - `check_for_conflict` method...validation and error detection can often account for more code than success path 
  - with the logic, Migration acts like a database transaction i.e. happens completely or not at all aka atomic
