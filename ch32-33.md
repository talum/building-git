# Chapter 32 Packs in the database 

- use packs as primary storage system for repositories to save space. 
- block storage on file system
- need an index saying where each object begins

## 32.1 Indexing packs
- convert to files or index the pack depending on the `fetch.unpackLimit` variable
  - kind of interesting that you can get the number of objects from the header
- generating the index
  - write pack directly to disk and create an index
  - hash the non deltas and store the offset and CRC32 for the object id
  - resolve deltas after all pack data is stored on disk
  - store the index 
- quick algorithm data structure detour about hash table
- store values in sorted order so we can use binary search
- fanout table

## 32.2 A new database backend
- loose objects (objects stored in a single file)
- good example of keeping the interface but replacing implementation

## 32.3 Offset deltas
- lol skip!


# Chapter 33 Working with remote branches
- associate locals with remotes
- kind of weird to introduce this at this point, huh?

## 33.1 log and list remotes
- use the prefix

## 33.2 upstream branches
- show the link
- upstream branch is the branch in a remote
- push to a default branch
- logic for adding upstream 

## 33.2.2 deleting branches
- check if branch merged
- check for a divergence 
  - uses a merge

## 33.2.5 Upstream setting
- default fetch/push to upstream so no need to run with arguments


# Chapter 34 And everything else
