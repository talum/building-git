# Chapter 23 Cherry picking

Wow we love the prime mark.
Head commit + delta is applied 

Changing the base to E's parent to figure out the diff and perform a "merge". In case of conflicts, can't just apply changes via a migration. Use `Resolve` to combine any two commits with any third commit as the base. Computes the tree diff for each side of the merge.

If two merge inputs contain same change relative to base, this does nto result in a conflict.
More like set addition rather than arithmetic.

## 23.1 Cherry-picking a single commit
- nice and composable
- use the interface 
- make a new struct called `CherryPick` with same inputs
- `pick` performs a merge and writes new commit 

### 23.1.1 New types of pending commit
- possible to get merge conflicts
- when we resume cherry pick we don't want to create merge conflict b/c it would block changes from earler in the branch being incorporated when branch is fully merged 
- store cherry-picked ID in `.git/CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` rather than `.git/MERGE_HEAD`

### 23.1.2 Resuming from conflicts
- check if index is in conflict
- make a new commit, add contents of CHERRY_PICK_NOTES
- update HEAD and clear pending commit state 

## 23.2 Multiple commits and ranges
- use `RevList` to locate all the commits to pick 

### 23.2.1 Rev-list without walking
- apply commits in same order they appear in history 
- iterate commits in reverese order 
- only iterate if inputs are ranges 

### 23.2.2 Conflicts during ranges
- recover if a series of commits fails part-way through
- `.git/sequencer` is where we need to store more state so that the cherry pick range can contiue
- use `RevList` to grab the commit list and store it in sequencer
- resume sequencing picks up wherever we left off 
- _crash-only design_: no seaprate code paths for where all comits apply cleanly versus when the chain is interrupted by conflicts 
  - design system so that it doesn't assume it's starting from a clean state 
  - store up all work that's left to be done, churn through it until you run out or crash 
  - similar to background- and batch-processing w/ database systems 

## 23.2.3 When all else fails 
- escape hatch with `--abort` and `--quit`
- `--quit` deletes state associated with cherry-pick, abandons cherry-pick but leaves HEAD, index, and workspace as they are 
- `--abort`more complicated. Erases cherry-pick state but returns to state of repository before cherry-pick started 
- cherry-pick safety when aborting. it won't do it if current state isn't one it recognizes (so you can't commit in between cherry picks)
- stores the ID of each commit it creates
-
