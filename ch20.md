# Chapter 20 Merging inside files

Hahaha merging when when both sides have edited same file -- hooray
git can detect different regions of file edited and reconcile changes

not looking at edits
performing 3-way merge between tips of two branches and common ancestor

diffs as a basis for further computation? ðŸ¤”

## 20.1 The diff3 algorithm

diff3 Unix utility 

- input 3 texts and produces single merged version w/ conflicts

### 20.1.1 
- calculate each diff between original and changed version
- align documents into chunks 
- for no conflict chunks, output original
- for chunks where conflict, emit for user
- when only one changed, pick change 

### 20.1.2 Implementing diff3
- new class, takes string arguments of original, a, b
- pass them all into algo
- match sets to record which lines in each version equal original 
  - diff against a
  - diff against b
- use match sets as an index? interesting. rather than compare the text. bc we know the line numbers 
- emit the chunks to construct output of merge algorithm 
- diff3 algo is relatively simple but sensitive to underlying diff algorithm

### 20.1.3 Using diff3 during mergee
- wow that was nice to just plug in huh

## 20.2 Logging merge commits
- `git log --cc` 
- `@@@` on hunk headers, multiple columns of plus/minus symbols => combo of diff between left vereesion and merge result and between right veresion and the merge result 
- those columns are hard to parse at a glance, gee
- in combined diff, each line has combo of single deletion, some cobo of inseertions and unchanged files all having same text 
- diff both sides with the original. create pairs of edit objects. 
- wow lotta work to get log working

### 20.2.1 Unifying hunks
- combined diffs displayed in hunks like regular ones
- `@@@` and multiple offsets
- combined row objeects


lol what
>  This can be resolved by realising that having a single value is just a special case of having multiple values.  
and yet i've seen this work before so many times

### 20.2.2 Diffs during merge conflicts
- using the above to print conflicted diff 

## 20.2.3 Diffs for merge commits
- check for merge by seing if there is more than one parent
- `--cc` prints combineed diff 

what a chapter
