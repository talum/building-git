# Chapter 13 Branching out

Branches: named references to multiple commits 

branches
- .git/refs/heads/master
- .git/refs/heads/topic 

refs contain a reference to the commit ID

Thoughts:
- when first learning git, the backwards arrows in the diagram confused me so much
- love a good Command class. Interesting that he started with writing the interface he wanted first.
- so many rules for branch names!
- shorthand language "revisions" -- how commonly do people use this?
- interesting digression into writing the Revision parser 
- use of Structs in the Revision class 
- parsing creates an AST
- "safe navigators" good or bad?
- interpreter design pattern
  - recursive evaluation
  - resolution
- prefix matching:
  - short commit ids 
  - greater chance of ambiguity / multiple matches
