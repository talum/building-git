# Chapter 29 Pushing Changes

- Push sends from local repository to the remote
- push relies on `git-receive-pack`
- push modifies `refs/heads` references in the remote repo -- can't overwrite changes from other clients

## 29.1 Shorthand refspecs
- shorter ways to write refspecs
- `git push origin master` 
- `master` is shorthand for `master:master`

## 29.2 The `push` and `receive-pack` commands
- get repo url from first arg or from configuration

### 29.2.1 Sending update requests
- push sends one message for every ref it wants to update, followed by a flush packet 
- oh, you can push more than one branch up at a time??? 
- unless forced, push only applies updates in cases where it has commit for the old id and has checked it's an ancestor of the new ID

- if `select_update` called with nil as source, it delegates to `select_deletion` method. remote must support `delete-refs` capability.
- nil references get converted to all-zero ID

### 29.2.2 Updating remote refs
- handling concurrency
- reject second of the updates and force them to merge other party's changes before trying to push again
- concurrency mechniasm builds on top of `Lockfile` -- but it states what the current state was at the time it began its request
- `compare-and-swap` atomically updates a mutable value only if current value is equal to what we expected
- `time to check to time of use` race condition 
- compare and swap is an optimistic control (vulnerable to the ABA problem but not an issue in Git because IDs have immmutable states of history)
- print out a summary
- after the push, keep `refs/remotes/` cache of remote state up to date


### 29.2.3 Validating update requests
- examples of blocking branch deletions and non-fast-forward updats
- `bare repository` just the contents of a `.git` directory


## 29.2 Progress meters
- this is cool, nice design element 
- test
