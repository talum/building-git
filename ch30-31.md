# Chapter 30: Delta Compression

Delta compression: way to compress objects but preserve ability to access them at random. Represent object as the difference between it and another.

XDelta algorithm: represent target from source as series of operations.

# Chapter 31: Compressing packs 

> By reading just the beginning of each object, we can get a little bit of information about it — its type and size — without reading the whole object from disk into memory

> One observation we can make from the above data is that objects tend to compress either very well or very poorly — there is not much middle ground.

Is this affected by user behavior?

> Prioritize objects that might be similar to each other, Git sorts objects in reverse order by type, name, and size. 

Inteeeeresting.
