# Chapter 21 Correcting mistakes

Core philosophy: don't lose data. lots of safety checks and warnings. and backup plans (orig_head)

Commit IDs don't change! 

## 21.1 Removing files from the index
- so far, the index has only gotten bigger
- could delete `.git/index` and rebuild it but that would be tedious

### 21.1.1 Preventing data loss
- Unix rm is unsafe
- git safer: 
> By default, it will only remove a fileiftheversionsofitstoredintheindexandtheworkspacematchwhat’sintheHEADcommit, i.e. there are no uncommitted or unstaged changes

- `plan_removal` method is cool -- checks for potential problems, exit on errors 
- dry run 

- `load_tree_entry`: fetches single `Database::Entry` from commit by pathname 
  - takes commit, path
  - load commit, find tree pointer, break path and walk down the tree to find the entry
- don't remove anything resulting in uncommitted data lost

### 21.1.2 Refinements to the `rm` command
- `--cached` removes only from index not workspace
- `--forced` safety checks skip 

`--cached` 
> The safety checks in this case are slightly modified. rm --cached refuses to delete an index entry if it differs from both the HEAD commit and the workspace, but if it differs from only one of themit’ssafetodelete

- `--r` option for recursive, can specify directory path 


## 21.2 Resetting the index state

`reset` command for making the index version match HEAD, not workspace file 

- add the `Command::Reset`
- insert tree entries from head commit into index

### 21.2.1 Resetting to a different commit 

>  The design of Git’s command-line user interface here presents a tricky parsing problem. The first argument to reset can be either a path to a file, or a revision, and there’s no way to tell it which type it is. 

first time author seems to complain? ambiguity! ugh, y so flexible? 

> This is a bad state of affairs: we cannot tell from the syntax of the command itself whether the word readme denotes the name of a file, or the name of a branch or other kind of commit identifier, and that means Git has to guess.

Git has to guess

## 21.3 Discarding commits from your branch
