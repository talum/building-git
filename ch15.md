# Chapter 15 Switching branches

- branch pointers need to follow HEAD so as not to lose track of commits
- need to keep track of latest commit added to their history

- branches have a common ancestor: the latest commit that appears in both of their histories 
- that commit can have multiple names: its object id, or any expression that resolves to it following chain of commit parents

## 15.1
Git uses symbolic refs (symrefs)

> We say that .git/HEAD contains a symref to refs/heads/master, which is the file containing the master branch pointer. That file may not exist yet if we’ve not made any commits, but whenwedo,thecommit’sIDwillbewrittento.git/refs/heads/masterand.git/HEADwill be unchanged.

### 15.1.1 Tracking branch pointers
- i appreciate the diagrams...this all makes way more sense 
- tho the sideways diagram is easier for me 2 parse


### 15.1.2 Detached `HEAD`
- HEAD can contain comit ID rather than symref (point directly at commit)
- this is called detached HEAD
- Q: Why would you make commits while in a detached HEAD state? (no branch pointer will move) 

### 15.1.3 Retaining detached histories
- okay you can create a new branch from detached mode to retain history 
- you need to checkout the new branch so that HEAD becomes a symref to the commit

## 15.2 Linking `HEAD` on checkout
- make the checkout command write symref to .git/HEAD if revision is name of branch 

### 15.2.1 Reading symbolic references
- keep everything working by adding ability to read symrefs
- follow the symref and return object ID
- recursively follow symrefs until find normal reference 

## 15.3 Printing checkout results
- warn if in detached state
- print name of branch
- needs more info! so we save current_ref before and after the checkout 
- `current_ref`: which file would be updated when we make a commit. similar to `read_symref`

> in a detached HEAD state, the current ref is HEAD rather than a branch pointer in refs/heads.

- detached state: This means that the current ref was not HEAD before the checkout, but it is HEAD afterward.


## 15.4 Updating `HEAD` on commit 

Updating the symref...

> Refs#update_symref works similarly to its read counterpart: it recursively reads symrefs until it finds a ref file that contains an object ID (or until it finds an absent file). 
Q: When would we need to recursively need to read symrefs? 
Or is that a preoptimization? 

Interesting that we hold onto several lockfiles while recursing and looking for the the file that doens't contain a symref!

The locks we were holding are all released in an ensure block. 

### 15.4.1 The master branch
- not special, just another pointer
- change the init to init with symref to master

## 15.5 Branch management
- branch deletion only deltes the pointers in /`.git/ref/heads/`, not the commits themselves

### 15.5.1 Parsing command line options 
- Ruby standard library OptionParser

### 15.5.2 Listing branches
- interesting that we need to calculate the width
- agree easier to work with structs and define methods on them rather than bare strings

### 15.5.3 Deleting branches
- delete the branch pointer and return the object ID the branch was pointing at 
- turn it into atomic operation by taking out a lock against the file before reading its contents and deleting it 
- need to clean up parent directories too that might have been created by the branch name 


Interesting:

> The relationship between the Command::Branch class and the Refs class shows a common design pattern, in which the command class contains user interface logic — recognising options, printing output and so on — and calls through to a back-end class to perform the actual operation.
