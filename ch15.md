# Chapter 15 Switching branches

- branch pointers need to follow HEAD so as not to lose track of commits
- need to keep track of latest commit added to their history

- branches have a common ancestor: the latest commit that appears in both of their histories 
- that commit can have multiple names: its object id, or any expression that resolves to it following chain of commit parents

## 15.1
Git uses symbolic refs (symrefs)

> We say that .git/HEAD contains a symref to refs/heads/master, which is the file containing the master branch pointer. That file may not exist yet if we’ve not made any commits, but whenwedo,thecommit’sIDwillbewrittento.git/refs/heads/masterand.git/HEADwill be unchanged.

### 15.1.1 Tracking branch pointers
- i appreciate the diagrams...this all makes way more sense 
- tho the sideways diagram is easier for me 2 parse


### 15.1.2 Detached `HEAD`
- HEAD can contain comit ID rather than symref (point directly at commit)
- this is called detached HEAD
- Q: Why would you make commits while in a detached HEAD state? (no branch pointer will move) 

### 15.1.3 Retaining detached histories
- okay you can create a new branch from detached mode to retain history 
- you need to checkout the new branch so that HEAD becomes a symref to the commit

## 15.2 Linking `HEAD` on checkout
- make the checkout command write symref to .git/HEAD if revision is name of branch 

### 15.2.1 Reading symbolic references
- keep everything working by adding ability to read symrefs
- follow the symref and return object ID
