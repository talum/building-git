# Chapter 16 Reviewing history

Get the history of changes to a project: building git log

## 16.1 Linear history
- use the pager so user can scroll through the history
- use yield so we can print commits as soon as read from db (no need to load everything in memory) -- a streaming effect

### 16.1.2
- `--pretty` or `--format` option, medium is default
- `--abrev-commit` instead of printing 40-digit commit ID, print the abbreviateed version 
 
### 16.1.3 One-line format
- formatting 
- not as interesting tbh. lots of nuts and bolts

### 16.1.4 Branch decoration
- `--decorate` labels each commit with the names of branches or other refs that point to it 
- make a lookup table of refs that point to each commit 
- the use of `and` is interesting 

```
def decorate(commit)
case @options[:decorate]
when "auto" then return "" unless @isatty when "no" then return ""
end
refs = @reverse_refs[commit.oid] return "" if refs.empty?
head, refs = refs.partition { |ref| ref.head? and not @current_ref.head? } names = refs.map { |ref| decoration_name(head.first, ref) }
fmt(:yellow, " (") + names.join(fmt(:yellow, ", ")) + fmt(:yellow, ")") end
```

### 16.1.5 Displaying patches
- print the idff when ya pass `--patch` flag

## 16.2 Branching histories
- add ability to pass in revision identifiers so you don't have to start from a specific point (HEAD)

### 16.2.1 Revision lists
- `log` is based on lower-level `rev-list`
- `RevList` will search the history. Pure refactor tho for now.

## 16.2.2 Logging multiple branches
- introduce idea of "common ancestor", commit X reachable from another commit?
- list each commit only once

>  Once multiple branches exist, it’s like we have parallel universes, and events on one branch don’t affect those on another.

- discuss some methods for printing out commits -- try alternating, pick the youngest
- separating the traversal of the commits is nice! (v similar to what we ended up doing for the file tree)

## 16.2.3 Excluding branches
- "what's happened on master since you diverged from it?"
- > git log topic..master, or git log ^topic master
- the caret tells Git to omit that commit and any commits that are reachable from it. 
- appreciate the graphs, phew 

## 16.2.4 Filtering by changed paths
- only show the commits that changed a particular file or directory
- this is a lot of code, more confusing in explaining it. almost like it's backwards from the way i expected it to be explained
- using `PathFilter` first and building it later is what confused me. 
- "marking it as uninteresting" -- seemed to come out of left field
- use the `filter` to go over entries in tree diff
- `PathFilter` uses a `trie` to represent the list of paths
