# Chapter 16 Reviewing history

Get the history of changes to a project: building git log

## 16.1 Linear history
- use the pager so user can scroll through the history
- use yield so we can print commits as soon as read from db (no need to load everything in memory) -- a streaming effect

### 16.1.2
- `--pretty` or `--format` option, medium is default
- `--abrev-commit` instead of printing 40-digit commit ID, print the abbreviateed version 
 
### 16.1.3 One-line format
- formatting 
- not as interesting tbh. lots of nuts and bolts

### 16.1.4 Branch decoration
- `--decorate` labels each commit with the names of branches or other refs that point to it 
- make a lookup table of refs that point to each commit 
- the use of `and` is interesting 

```
def decorate(commit)
case @options[:decorate]
when "auto" then return "" unless @isatty when "no" then return ""
end
refs = @reverse_refs[commit.oid] return "" if refs.empty?
head, refs = refs.partition { |ref| ref.head? and not @current_ref.head? } names = refs.map { |ref| decoration_name(head.first, ref) }
fmt(:yellow, " (") + names.join(fmt(:yellow, ", ")) + fmt(:yellow, ")") end
```

### 16.1.5 Displaying patches
- print the idff when ya pass `--patch` flag

## 16.2 Branching histories
- add ability to pass in revision identifiers so you don't have to start from a specific point (HEAD)

### 16.2.1 Revision lists
- `log` is based on lower-level `rev-list`
- `RevList` will search the history. Pure refactor tho for now.

## 16.2.2 Logging multiple branches
