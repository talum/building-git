# Chapter 22

start launching user text editor whenever they need to compose a message

## 22.1 Setting the commit message

- add support for commnad line options 

## 22.2 Composing the commit message
- walkthrough of designing programs from the outside in
- commit message path: COMMIT_EDITMSG
- initial content, final content 
- get name of user's editor program from env variable
  - VISUAL
  - EDITOR
  - GIT_EDITOR 

### 22.2.1 Launching the editor
- strips out the commented lines from the edit msg file 
- Shellwords.shellsplit(@command) 
- atom editor requires atom --wait
- `system` waits / blocks until the child process exists. makes child process use same standard output/error streams as the Ruby process (why Vim waits until you quit)

### 22.2.2 Starting and resuming merges
- PendingCommit class stored inputs to the merge command while it was suspended for user to resolve conflicts
- on merge conflict, write the conflicted files as comments 


### 22.3 Reusing messages
- common use case to reset to move back a couple commits while keep workspace and index unchanged 
- not really changing objects bc Git commits are immutable. actually adding new commits and changing what the refs point to 
- amending the HEAD - builds new commit with the same parents as the current HEAD
  - add a committer bc author and committer might not be the same
- RevList uses timestamps to order its search of the history and determine when to stop
