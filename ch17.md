# Chapter 17 Basic merging

## 17.1 What is a merge?

- the merge commit has two parents
- the state of C is as expected, the contents of the topic branch "win"

## 17.1.2 Merging a chain of commits
- "apply the change introduced by the given commit to the current HEAD"
- merge incorporates the changes from every commit that's reachable from topic but not from HEAD (the revision range ..topic)
- nearest commit reachable from HEAD and merged branch -- the best common ancestor aka the merge base aka the point at which the history of the two branches diverged

## 17.1.3 Interpreting merges
- Calculates changes since they diverged
- Build the final tree by adding differences to tree B 
- This is a "three-way merge" commonly used in distributed systems. "To achieve consensus, they compare their chnages to the last version they agreed on, and add those changes together"

-  The merge command only represents a vaible way to merge tree structures when parties have changed different parts of the tree (does not ensure resulting tree works)
-  merge commits have multiple parents
   - plays a role in determining the content of new commits b/c it's used to determine where two branches diverged and what changes to apply when performing a merge
   - helps us understand where the best common ancestor is so we don't need to reapply changes
-  Git uses the graph to determine which changes have been incorporated and doesn't need to examine the content of those commits

## 17.2 Finding the best common ancestor
- only use dates to prioritize the search
- find BCA with a loop. Return the one with both the parent1 and parent2 flag

## 17.3 Commits with multiple parents
- introduce method to return first parent
- add ability to write commits with 2 parents
- create Comand::Commit class so we can generate commits

## 17.4 Performing a merge
- load the index for updates
- update the index and workspace
- calculate the tree diff between base_oid and merge_oid aka the net change on the merged branch since it diverged from the history of HEAD
- Repository::Migration class will write changes and index will contain the tree of the merge commit aka the tree of HEAD plus the changes from the merged branch
- write the updated index to disk, write a commit 

- NOTE: calculate the net difference so you don't need to go over entire history 

## 17.5 Best common ancestors with merges
- in the presence of merge commits, history forms a DIRECTED ACYLIC GRAPH (DAG)
- "A best common ancestor of commits X and Y is any common ancestor that is not an ancestor of any other common ancestor"
- can't stop at the first merge commit you find b/c of complex histories
- maintain a list of every commit like that we find...flag a candidate result 
- flag :stale to its parents so that the result commits are excluded from the results 
- apply CommonAncestors again to every pair of result commits to discover which are ancestors of others and remove them from the result set
- recursive strategy to resolve if multiple common ancestors are found 

## 17.6 Logs in a merging history
- follow all parents that lead to it when we encounter a merge commit
- hide patches for merges entirely
- "treesame commits" -- commits that don't change the given files
- if a commit is treesame to any of its parents for the given files, we ignore it 

## 17.7 Revisions with multiple parents
- expand revisions notation 
- <rev>^ <rev>~<n> -- they follow the first parent pointer
- <rev>^<n> if you want to identify a different parent 
- select the required parent
