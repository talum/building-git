# Chapter 19 Conflict Resolution

## 19.1 Printing conflict warnings

- Add an `on_progress` hook to `Merge::Resolve` -- neato
- add some logs!

## 19.2 Conflicted status

- add conflicted state to status to keep track of conflicts, along with the stage
- add some labels

## 19.3 Conflicted diffs
- _combined diff_ shows the difference between the workspace copy of the file and the stage 2 and 3 index entries simultaneously

### 19.3.1 Unmerged paths
- way to print the conflicted diff

### 19.3.2 Selecting stages
- option to see diff between specific version of file before merge and file in workspace 
- `--base` or `-1` shows file from base of merge 
- `--ours` or `-2` bases diff on left side of merge
- `--theirs` or `-3` based on the right side (incoming merged commit)

### 19.4 Resuming a merge
- tell git what the tree should look like and have it write a merge commit 
- add, make it remove conflict entries before inserting stage-0 entry
- retain state across commands
- save the original message and ID of the right-hand commit 
- create a `PendingCommit` and write hea doid and message values to disk into `.git/MERGE_HEAD` and `.git/MERGE_MSG`
- we clear it after merge runs successfully
- add the `--continue` option to the `merge` command 
- `in_progress?` checks if `.git/MERGE_HEAD` exists 
- `resume_merge`method writes commit, clears pending commit
- handle errors
